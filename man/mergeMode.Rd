\title{Combine Positive and Negative Mode Results}
\usage{
mergeMode(posData, negData)
}
\arguments{
\item{posData}{Data frame of merged results from positive mode (output of \code{\link{easy_mergeMetabo}} with \code{mode="pos"}). Should contain a compound identifier column (e.g. `Compound_ID` or `Compound`) and score columns.}

\item{negData}{Data frame of merged results from negative mode (output of \code{easy_mergeMetabo} with \code{mode="neg"}). Must have the same format and identifiers as posData.}
}
\value{
A combined data frame containing data from both modes. If a compound is found in both modes, only the entry with the highest Score (and highest Fragmentation_Score tie-breaker) is retained. Each row includes an identifier (e.g. Compound or Compound_ID), the polarity of origin, and all other associated data columns.
}
\description{
Merges the results from positive and negative modes into a single data frame, selecting the best scoring entry for each compound across both modes.
}
\details{
This function simply binds the two data frames and then groups by the compound identifier (here assumed to be a column named `Compound_ID`). Within each group, it keeps the record with the highest `Score`. If there are ties in Score, it further filters to the highest `Fragmentation_Score`. The result is ungrouped and returned as a standard data frame.
