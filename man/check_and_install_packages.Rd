}
\arguments{
\item{packages}{Character vector of package names to check and install.}

}
\description{
Ensures that a list of R packages are installed. If a package is not installed, it will be installed from CRAN.
}
\details{
This utility function will attempt to load each package using `require()`. If a package is not found, it calls `install.packages()` to install it, then loads it. This is mainly used to ensure all required libraries for the Shiny app are available.
