}
\description{
Launches the Shiny app for metabolite quantitative/qualitative combined analysis included in this package.
}
\details{
The Shiny app UI and server logic are contained in the \code{inst/app/} directory of the package. This function finds the app directory and calls \code{shiny::runApp()} to launch it. Ensure you have the required input files ready (sample info and measurement/identification files for both modes) before running the app.
